# Token Filtering & Full Transaction History Update

## Overview
This update addresses two critical requirements:
1. **Filter out spam/dusting tokens** - Only show whitelisted legitimate tokens
2. **Include ALL transactions in PDF** - Remove the 100 transaction limit

## Changes Made

### 1. Token Whitelist System (`blockchain_service.py`)

Added a comprehensive whitelist of legitimate tokens across multiple chains:

**Supported Tokens:**
- **Ethereum**: USDT, USDC, WETH, DAI, WBTC, MATIC, LINK, UNI
- **Polygon**: USDT, USDC, WETH, WMATIC, DAI, WBTC, LINK, UNI, AAVE
- **BSC**: USDT, USDC, ETH, WBNB, DAI
- **Arbitrum**: USDT, USDC, WETH, DAI, WBTC
- **Optimism**: USDT, USDC, WETH, DAI
- **Base**: USDC, WETH, DAI

**How it Works:**
```python
# Only tokens in WHITELISTED_TOKENS dictionary are included
# Non-whitelisted tokens are filtered out automatically
_is_whitelisted_token(contract_address) -> bool
```

### 2. Automatic Spam Filtering

Token transactions are now filtered in `_parse_token_tx()`:
- Returns `None` for non-whitelisted tokens
- Logs filtered tokens for debugging
- Only whitelisted tokens appear in results

**Native transactions (ETH, MATIC, BNB, etc.) are ALWAYS included** - no filtering applied.

### 3. Full Transaction History in PDF (`pdf_generator.py`)

**REMOVED:** 100 transaction limit
```python
# OLD: limited_transactions = transactions[:100]
# NEW: All transactions included
```

**ADDED:** Token information section showing which tokens are included
- Lists all whitelisted tokens found in transactions
- Explains filtering policy
- Provides transparency about what's included

### 4. Fixed AED Currency Display

**REMOVED:** Arabic characters د.إ (displayed as ■■)
**REPLACED WITH:** Plain text "AED"

All currency displays now show:
- `$123.45 USD`
- `AED 453.87`

## Benefits

✅ **No more spam tokens** - Dusting attacks and scam tokens filtered out automatically
✅ **Complete history** - All transactions included in PDF reports
✅ **Transparency** - PDF shows which tokens are included
✅ **Better performance** - Less data to process without spam tokens
✅ **Cleaner reports** - Only legitimate tokens shown

## Testing

To test the new features:

1. **Open your frontend** (http://localhost:3000 or wherever hosted)
2. **Enter a Polygon address** that has many transactions
3. **Export to PDF**

Expected results:
- PDF will include ALL transactions (not just 100)
- Only whitelisted tokens will appear in Token Transfer transactions
- Native MATIC transactions always included
- PDF shows "Included Tokens: USDT, USDC, ..." section
- AED displays as "AED 123.45" not "■■ 123.45"

## Adding New Tokens to Whitelist

To add more tokens, edit `blockchain_service.py`:

```python
WHITELISTED_TOKENS = {
    # Add new token (address must be lowercase)
    '0x_new_token_address': {'symbol': 'TOKEN', 'name': 'Token Name'},
}
```

**Important:** Contract addresses must be lowercase!

## Debug Output

The backend now logs:
```
DEBUG: Filtering out non-whitelisted token: SCAMTOKEN at 0x123...
DEBUG BACKEND: First 3 transaction amounts: [0.5, 1.2, 0.001]
DEBUG: Total in: 100.5, Total out: 50.2, Net: 50.3
```

These help verify the filtering and calculations are working correctly.

## Summary

This update transforms the system from showing ALL tokens (including spam) to a curated, professional account statement with only legitimate tokens and complete transaction history. Perfect for generating clean, comprehensive financial reports!
