# Quick Fix Summary - October 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Polygon Network Update: MATIC → POL
**Problem:** System showed "MATIC" for Polygon native token, but Polygon migrated to "POL"

**Solution:**
- Updated `backend.py`: Changed `'polygon': 'MATIC'` to `'polygon': 'POL'`
- Updated `currency_service.py`: Added POL price mapping
- Updated `blockchain_service.py`: Added POL token to whitelist
- Both MATIC (legacy) and POL (new) now supported

### 2. ✅ Balance Reporting Verification
**Problem:** Needed to verify balance calculations were accurate

**Solution:**
- Verified all decimal conversions are correct
- Confirmed native token balances: `/1e18` for EVM, `/1e8` for BTC
- Confirmed token balances use correct decimals (6, 8, or 18)
- All calculations verified accurate

### 3. ✅ Extended Token Support
**Added price mappings for:**
- LINK (Chainlink)
- UNI (Uniswap)
- AAVE (Aave)
- POL (Polygon Ecosystem Token)

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. **backend/backend.py**
   - Line 217: Updated Polygon symbol to POL
   
2. **backend/currency_service.py**
   - Line 73-78: Added POL, LINK, UNI, AAVE to symbol_map
   
3. **backend/blockchain_service.py**
   - Line 43: Added POL token contract (Ethereum mainnet)
   - Line 42: Updated MATIC description to "(Legacy)"
   - Line 133: Extended token filter to include POL and MATIC

### New Documentation Files
1. **POLYGON_POL_UPDATE.md** - Detailed explanation of POL/MATIC migration
2. **BALANCE_VERIFICATION.md** - Comprehensive balance calculation verification

## How to Test

### Test Polygon Network
```bash
# Navigate to the app
http://localhost:5000

# Select "Polygon" blockchain
# Enter any Polygon address
# Generate PDF

# Expected:
✅ Native token shows as "POL" (not MATIC)
✅ Balances are accurate
✅ Can also see WMATIC if held as ERC-20 token
```

### Test Ethereum Network with POL
```bash
# Select "Ethereum" blockchain
# Enter address that holds POL tokens
# Generate PDF

# Expected:
✅ Native token shows as "ETH"
✅ POL appears in token balances if held
✅ MATIC (legacy) also tracked separately if held
```

## Before & After

### Before
```
Polygon Network:
Native Token: MATIC ❌
```

### After
```
Polygon Network:
Native Token: POL ✅

Token Balances (if held):
- WMATIC (Wrapped MATIC)
- USDT, USDC, etc.
```

## Key Points

1. **POL is the new native token** on Polygon network
2. **MATIC still exists** as legacy ERC-20 token on Ethereum
3. **WMATIC** is the wrapped version on Polygon
4. **Prices are the same** for POL and MATIC (1:1)
5. **All balance calculations verified accurate**

## What You Need to Know

- **No action needed** from users
- **Old PDFs** may still show "MATIC" - this is normal
- **New PDFs** will show "POL" for Polygon network
- **Both tokens tracked** if you hold them on Ethereum

## Deployment

Ready to deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update Polygon to POL, verify balance calculations, extend token support"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.
